### Anyone having trouble since the 5.0 update, use the 4.7.1 file...

1. download the apk file
2. allow or give it permission
3. install it

You can verify that it's me, crrdlx, the person who made the app, by cross-referencing my credentials at https://keybase.io/crrdlx or https://keybase.pub/crrdlx/ (this same apk file is also located there).
