#### Satoshi Bitcoin Converter - Progressive Web App

Please use the PWA version of the app at https://satoshibitcoinconverter.com The Android app is no longer supported. The PWA version is the latest and most efficient.

The Satoshi Bitcoin Converter (SBC) began in [June of 2013](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=239948.msg2541921#msg2541921). The initial goal was to help juggle between Bitcoin units, decimals, satoshis (sats) and their live USD values. It was also to revert back the other way, from USD to BTC values.

It started as a personal tool, then a website, then an Android app in the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.satoshi.bitcoin.converter&hl=en_US) (no longer supported), then back to a website format, and finally to a Progressive Web App (PWA).

Though started as a personal tool, the hope is that it has been a small contribution to Bitcoin and has helped some people along the way.

The "dev" (crrdlx) has only slight dev skills, open source help is welcome! Simplicity and usefulness are the goals.
